To Set Up the Teensys with all their communication and IMU Shenanigans, there are a few steps you need to follow:

1. If you haven't already, install vscode and get the platformio extension

2. Open the Communication folder in vscode (the folder this README is in) 

3. Open the platformio menu on the left side (the alien icon) and project tasks should appear
    - The transmitter and receiver each have their own dropdowns with actions such as build or upload for each.
